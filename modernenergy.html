                    <h3>1. BioMass</h3>
                    <p><pre>
                    Biomass refers to organic materials derived from living organisms, typically plants 
                    and animals, that can be used as a source of energy. This renewable energy source can 
                    be utilized for various purposes, including heat and power generation, as well as the 
                    production of biofuels. Biomass is considered renewable because it comes from recently living organisms and can be replenished over time.

                    Here are some key aspects of biomass:
                        
                    Types of Biomass:
                        
                    <b>Wood and Agricultural Residues:</b> This includes wood chips, sawdust, crop residues,
                    and other by-products from forestry and agriculture.
                    Organic Waste: Municipal solid waste, food scraps, and other organic waste materials can be processed to extract energy.
                    Animal Manure: Livestock waste can be used for biogas production through anaerobic digestion.
                    Conversion Technologies:
                        
                    <b>Combustion:</b> Biomass can be burned directly to produce heat or generate electric
                    Gasification: This process converts biomass into a gas (syngas) that can be used for electricity generation or converted into biofuels.
                    Anaerobic Digestion: Microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen,
                    producing biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) that can be used for energy.
                    Biochemical Conversion: Enzymes and microorganisms are used to convert biomass into biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel.
                    Environmental Benefits:

                    <b>Land Use:</b> Large-scale biomass production can compete with food crops for land, raising concerns about food security and biodiversity.
                    Emissions: While biomass is considered renewable, its combustion can still release
                     pollutants and contribute to air quality issues if not properly managed.
                   </pre>
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. GEOTHERMAL:</h3>
                    <p><pre>Energy Source:

                    Geothermal energy is derived from the heat stored within the Earth's interior. This heat
                     originates from the radioactive decay of minerals and the residual heat from the planet's
                    formation.

                    <b>Tectonic Activity:</b>   
                    Regions with high levels of tectonic activity, such as along plate boundaries, are often 
                    associated with geothermal resources. These areas have increased heat flow from the Earth's mantle to the surface.

                   <b> Geothermal Power Generation:</b>    
                    Geothermal power plants convert the Earth's heat into electricity. There are several 
                    types of geothermal power plants, including dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle
                    plants. These plants use different methods to extract and utilize geothermal heat.

                    <b>Direct Use Applications:</b>    
                    Geothermal energy can be used directly for various purposes:
                    Heating: Hot water from underground reservoirs can be used for heating homes, buildings,
                    and industrial processes.
                    Cooling: Geothermal heat pumps can provide efficient cooling by transferring heat from buildings to the ground.

                    <b>Geothermal Heat Pumps:    </b>
                    These systems use the relatively constant temperature of the Earth below the surface to 
                    provide heating or cooling for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. They 
                    are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.

                    <b>Environmental Benefits:</b>
                    Geothermal resources are found globally, but they are more abundant in certain regions.
                    Countries such as Iceland, the United States, Philippines, and New Zealand have significant geothermal power production.

                    <b>Challenges:</b>    
                    Geothermal energy's widespread adoption is hindered by certain challenges:
                    Location Dependency: Geothermal resources are location-specific, and not all regions have economically viable geothermal potential.
                    Initial Costs: The drilling and installation of geothermal systems can be expensive,
